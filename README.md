# Django_Expense_Report_App
Many small to mid-sized businesses encounter a common problem when trying to submit their expense reports for their employers to get reimbursements. The procedure is often tedious and labor-intensive because they need to compile a list of expenses that can be allocated to different project codes and receipt backups that correspond to the expenses. My solution is to create a user-friendly app that allows users to add projects and allocate each expense to the matching project. Accounting staff can then draw up all the expenses associated to the particular project code and bill conveniently.

Allow user to add projects they are working on and enter reimbursable expenses associated with the project. Users are able to upload receipt backups, edit and delete record. Multiple-apps and RESTFUL routing, API and AJAX.
